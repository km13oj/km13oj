# km13oj Portfolio Site

## Welcome to my standin portfolio website. This repo is where I'm building a new portfolio.
## You're obviously lost, but surprisingly curious. If you have any questions about my code, or want to yell at me for using too much marbled paper, please reach out at kmeyerto@gmail.com.

# Prerequisites

## You wouldn't happen to have Lombok, the font, installed on your computer, would you? I love that font, and can't get a good export to web font. If you don't have Lombok, you will have to contend with Gill. My apologies. 

# Built With

## HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript forthcoming. The weird little squares are all CSS. 
## I made marbled paper and photographed it at home for the background image.
